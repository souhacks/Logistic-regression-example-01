# Logistic-regression-example-01: Advertising Dataset
The dataset indicates whether or not a user clicked on an advertisement on a company website. I created a logistic regression model to predict whether the user will click on an ad based off the features of that user. Dataset:

Daily Time Spent on Site
Age
Area Income: Avg income of the geographical area of the user
Daily Internet Usage
Ad Topic Line
City
Male
Country
Timestamp
Clicked on Ad (0 or 1)
